## Problem Statement
Analyse HR Data to help an organization to improve the employee performance and identify what factors impact the retention (reduce attrition).


## Datasource
The data is in the form of excel file with `33 columns` and `1470 records`. 


## Data Preparation
  1. Create Dataset
  2. Import dataset into SQL SERVER
  3. Understanding the data :
     <br>
     After collecting the data it is very important to know the data and understanding what has to be done to get meaningful insights.

  4. Data Cleaning :
     <br>
     In this step we examine the data to check for any null or duplicate values. If it is there then we remove those values using appropriate strategies.

  5. Creation of new columns from existing ones :
     - Added new column as `age_group`.
     - Added new column as `monthly_income_group`.
     - Added new column as `perc_sal_hike_range` which contains range of percentage of salary hike given to employees.
